Uses for Jupyter Notebook include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

Doing this repeatedly using a mouse (or trackpad) can be tedious. But there's a better way: keyboard shortcuts!\n",

Keyboard navigation is much more predictable and precise, which allows us to express our ideas in code much more fluidly, and to make edits to existing code faster, and with more confidence. While we don't need to use keyboard shortcuts exclusively yet &mdash; even professional developers will still use the mouse occasionally &mdash; it's a good idea to start getting used to them as soon as possible. The more we use them, the more habitual they become.\n",

This is usually just written as `⌘/` or `⌘+/`. If you are on a line which is already a comment, `⌘/` will remove the comment mark. You can toggle between a comment and not a comment by repeatedly pressing `⌘/`.\n",

Notice how much faster it is than moving the mouse to a comment symbol, pressing delete, moving to and clicking the play button, moving back to the start of the line and typing a comment symbol, then moving on to the next line. It may not seem like a lot, but we do operations like this all the time while writing code, so even small efficiencies can really add up over time!"
